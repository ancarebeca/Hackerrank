https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-sorting

**Task** 
Given an array, a , of size n  containing distinct elements a[0],a[1], ... a[n-1] sort array  a in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following  lines:

1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps 
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2. First Element: firstElement 
where firstElement  is the first element in the sorted array.

3. Last Element: lastElement
where  lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

**Sample Input 0**

```
3
1 2 3
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
```

**Sample Input 1**

```
3
3 2 1
```

**Sample Output 1**

```
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
```
